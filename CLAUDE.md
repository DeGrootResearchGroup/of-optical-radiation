## Project Overview

**opticalRadiation** is an OpenFOAM library and standalone solver for the
**radiative transfer equation** in absorbing/scattering participating media,
focused on optical wavelengths. The discrete-ordinates method (DOM) is used
with multi-band spectral support, anisotropic phase functions, refractive
interfaces, and Lambertian/specular boundary conditions.

The solver is decoupled from the energy equation. Volumetric thermal
emission (`n²σT⁴`) is intentionally absent: the model is intended for
applications where light comes from external boundaries or known sources
rather than from the temperature of the medium itself (photobioreactors,
optical-property characterisation, photochemistry, etc.). To make this
explicit, the dictionary lives in `constant/opticalRadiationProperties`
and there is no coupling into a host's energy or temperature solver
unless the user wires one up via their own fvModels.

The library is the core artifact; the standalone solver and the fvModel
wrapper both link against it.

## Architecture

### Build Outputs

| Component | Type | Install Path |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `libopticalRadiation` | Shared library (model + BCs + fvModel) | `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN/libopticalRadiation.so` |
| `opticalRadiationFoam` | Single-region standalone solver | `$FOAM_USER_APPBIN/opticalRadiationFoam` |
| `libopticalRadiationModule` | `Foam::solvers::opticalRadiation` solver module for `foamMultiRun` | `$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN/libopticalRadiationModule.so` |

Two ways to embed radiation in a multi-physics case:
- For pure-radiation regions inside a multi-region case, use the
  solver-module form via `regionSolvers { region opticalRadiation; }`
  in `controlDict`, with `libs ("libopticalRadiationModule.so")`.
- For regions where another primary physics (flow, solid heat) drives
  the time loop, embed the fvModel wrapper via the case's `fvModels`
  dict; `libs ("libopticalRadiation.so")` (the main library) is enough.

Source layout (OpenFOAM-style):
- `src/opticalRadiationModels/`                — library source (radiationModel,
  DOM, extinctionModels, phaseFunctionModels, derivedFvPatchFields, fvModels).
- `applications/solvers/opticalRadiationFoam/` — standalone binary.
- `applications/modules/opticalRadiation/`     — solver module.

### Class Hierarchy

```
Foam::optical::

  IOdictionary
  └── radiationModel              (abstract base; reads opticalRadiationProperties)
      └── DOM                     (discrete-ordinates implementation)
              ├── phaseFunctionModel   (phase function for in-scattering)
              └── PtrList<intensityRay>   (one per direction × band)

  extinctionModel                 (absorption & scattering coefficients)
    ├── noExtinction
    ├── wideBandConstantExtinction
    └── wideBandVariableExtinction   (auto-loads species fields if not registered)

  phaseFunctionModel              (phase function P(θ) between ray pairs)
    ├── HenyeyGreensteinModel
    ├── schlickModel
    └── nullModel

  mixedFvPatchScalarField         (boundary conditions; active set)
    ├── diffuseEmitterMixedFvPatchScalarField
    ├── reflectiveMixedFvPatchScalarField
    └── refractiveCoupledMixedFvPatchScalarField

Foam::fv::

  fvModel
  └── opticalRadiation            (fvModel wrapper for embedding into host solvers)
```

The `src/opticalRadiationModels/inScatterModels/` tree is on disk but
excluded from the build — its functionality is provided by
`phaseFunctionModels` instead.

There is currently no exterior-refraction BC. If a use case lands
(e.g. transmission through an outer window), write one fresh
alongside `refractiveCoupled` rather than reviving the legacy
`transExteriorSurface` that was deleted — it predated the pixelation
and étendue-n² methodology fixes.

### Key Files

### Solver Main Loop

```cpp
// opticalRadiationFoam.C
while (runTime.loop())
{
    radiationModel->correct();    // triggers DOM::calculate()
    runTime.write();
}
```

The DOM `calculate()` does its own inner iteration loop over rays until
either `convergence` (max residual across all rays at end of an outer
sweep) or `maxIter` is reached.

## Current State

### OpenFOAM v13 Foundation Compatibility

Library, standalone solver, and fvModel wrapper all build cleanly
against OpenFOAM v13 Foundation in the Docker image built from
`Dockerfile`. The migration from the original (OF v2–v5 era) source is
complete; the following methodological corrections were made on top of
the API port:

- Pixelisation discretisation fixed (`2*nPhi*nTheta`, `Δφ = π/nPhi`,
  pixel centres at `(i + 0.5)*Δ`); convention notes in
  `radiationModel.H` and `DOM.H`.
- Convergence check now uses the maximum residual across all rays in
  one outer sweep, not just the last ray's.
- `n²` factor included in the transmitted-radiance contribution at
  refractive interfaces (radiance invariant is `I/n²`).
- Fresnel cosines computed from continuous reflection / refraction
  directions, not snapped to a pixel grid.
- `dirToPhi` and `dirToRayId` clamped against the angular-discretisation
  edges (south pole, φ-seam) so direction lookups don't overflow.
- `refractiveCoupled::write()` emits `nBands`; `nNbg`/`nOwn`
  are size-checked against `nBands` on read.

### Methodology notes — settled design decisions

A few aspects of the discrete-ordinates implementation look surprising
on first read but are intentional. Recorded here so future-you doesn't
re-litigate them.

- **Pixel-area sign classification by central direction (not integral).**
  Murthy & Mathur (1998), Eqs. (21)–(22) explicitly define Approach B
  as central-direction classification of the whole-pixel vector
  integral `S_pi`. The residual O(pixel) misclassification of pixels
  that straddle a face is the inherent discretisation error of the
  method, controlled by `nPixelTheta` / `nPixelPhi`.

- **Tangent pixels (`d_pi · Sf == 0`) dropped by both `pos` and `neg`.**
  When the central direction is exactly tangent to a face, the integral
  `intDirOmega · Sf` is also ≈ 0 (leading term `d_pi · Sf · ω_pixel`,
  with only an O(pixel²) deviation). Dropping the contribution incurs
  O(pixel²) error — smaller than the method's inherent O(pixel) error.
  Murthy's spec assigns tangent pixels to `α_in` (the `≤ 0` branch);
  practical impact of either choice is negligible.

- **No special handling for non-invertibility of the pixel→ray map at
  reflective/refractive interior faces.** Reflection
  `r(d) = d − 2(d·n)n` is its own inverse, and Snell refraction is
  reversible, so the Phase 1 candidate-finding and Phase 2
  contribution-accepting in `intensityRay` are bookkeeping-symmetric
  in the continuous limit. With finite pixelation, sub-pixel-sized
  overlaps are missed *symmetrically* by both phases — no
  double-counting. The miss is the inherent
  O(1/(npTheta · npPhi)) discretisation error, controlled by refining
  pixel counts.

- **Pixelation applied at every interior face, not just boundaries.**
  Murthy noted empirically that interior pixelation didn't matter on
  his test cases. Fluent's DO theory guide (§5.3.6.3) is more general:
  pixelation applies to "each overhanging control angle", which on
  unstructured polyhedral meshes occurs at most interior faces (the
  global angular grid is fixed in xyz but face normals point in
  arbitrary directions). The current implementation matches Fluent's
  design — set `nPixelTheta = nPixelPhi = 1` (default) for cheap
  Approach-A behaviour, raise to 3×3 or higher when specular /
  semi-transparent BCs or anisotropic angular distributions are
  present.

- **2-D meshes restricted to the x-y plane.** Documented limitation,
  not a bug. Generalising would require axis-aware ray placement (or
  an internal mesh rotation); the workaround (re-orient the mesh) is
  trivial. `checkDim_` rejects 2-D meshes in x-z or y-z.

### fvModel Wrapper (`src/opticalRadiationModels/fvModels/opticalRadiation/`)

Compiles into `libopticalRadiation`. Owns the radiation `I` field
(read from disk, `MUST_READ`) and the `radiationModel` instance.
`addSupFields()` returns empty: the model does not push source terms
into host equations directly; `G` is exposed via the mesh registry
and any downstream coupling (e.g. `G` driving species growth) belongs
in the host's own fvModels. `correct()` solves the RTE each time the
host invokes `fvModels::correct()`.

### Solver Module (`applications/modules/opticalRadiation/`)

`Foam::solvers::opticalRadiation`, derived from `Foam::solver`.
Compiles into `libopticalRadiationModule`. Listed in
`controlDict.regionSolvers` to drive a region under `foamMultiRun`.

Implementation choices:
- The radiation solve goes in `preSolve()` (start of time step). All
  other lifecycle hooks (`momentumPredictor`, `pressureCorrector`,
  `thermophysicalPredictor`, etc.) are no-ops — radiation has no
  contributions to those equations.
- Caveat: `preSolve()` runs before `moveMesh()`. For static meshes
  (the only case currently used) this is correct. For moving meshes
  the solve should move to `prePredictor()` (post-motion, inside the
  PIMPLE loop).

End-to-end runtime tests of both forms ship as tutorials:
- `tutorials/fvModelChannel2D` exercises the fvModel inside
  `incompressibleFluid` (driven by `foamRun`) and confirms G is
  bit-for-bit identical to `tutorials/diffuseSlab2D`'s standalone-solver
  answer.
- `tutorials/refractiveInterface2D` exercises the solver-module form
  via `foamMultiRun` with two regions both running `opticalRadiation`.

### Multi-region cases — no dedicated binary

There is no standalone multi-region solver. The legacy
`multiRegionOpticalRadiationFoam` was incompatible with v13 Foundation
(removed `fvCFD.H` / `regionProperties.H`; the `regionProperties`-based
multi-region paradigm itself is gone in v13, replaced by
`MultiRegionRefs` / `MultiRegionList`) and was deleted.

Cross-region refractive-index BCs work either through:
- `foamMultiRun` driving the `opticalRadiation` solver module per
  region, with mapped patches between regions and the
  `refractiveCoupled` BC; or
- the fvModel wrapper embedded in each region's host solver.

The `tutorials/refractiveInterface2D` case exercises the first path.

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Inside Docker container or with OpenFOAM 13 environment sourced:
cd /path/to/repo
./Allwmake               # builds library + standalone solver + module
```

`Allwmake` runs `wmake libso` for the library, `wmake` for the
standalone solver, and `wmake libso` for the solver module, in order.

For piecewise builds:

```bash
( cd src/opticalRadiationModels              && wmake libso ) # library
( cd applications/solvers/opticalRadiationFoam && wmake )      # solver
( cd applications/modules/opticalRadiation    && wmake libso ) # module
```

## OpenFOAM v13 Foundation Reference

- **Source**: `openfoam13` Docker image from `dl.openfoam.org` (built
  from this repo's `Dockerfile`).
- **Environment**: source `/opt/openfoam13/etc/bashrc` before building.
- **fvModel base class**: `$FOAM_SRC/finiteVolume/cfdTools/general/fvModels/fvModel.H`.
- **Tutorial reference for fvModels**: `$FOAM_TUTORIALS` — search for
  cases with an `fvModels` entry.
- **Dictionary API note**: OF v13 Foundation does **not** have the
  `dict.get<T>()` / `dict.getOrDefault<T>()` shortcuts (those are
  ESI-only). Use `readLabel(dict.lookup("key"))`,
  `readScalar(dict.lookup("key"))`, and
  `dict.lookupOrDefault<T>("key", default)` instead.

## Tutorials & validation

`tutorials/` ships five cases:

- **`diffuseSlab2D`** — 2-D plane-parallel slab, mirror sides, validated
  against `2π·L_w·E_2(κx)`.
- **`absorbingScatteringBox3D`** — 3-D box, four bands, constant
  extinction + Henyey-Greenstein scattering.
- **`variableExtinctionBox3D`** — same as above but driven by species
  fields (`X1`, `X2`, `S1`, `S2`); equivalent to the constant case at
  uniform 0.5 concentrations and produces a bit-for-bit identical `G`.
- **`refractiveInterface2D`** — 2-D two-region case verifying the
  `refractiveCoupled` BC at a refractive-index step (n_A=1.0, n_B=1.5)
  with a collimated beam source, validated against the
  Fresnel-transmission analytical with the étendue n² factor. Runs via
  `foamMultiRun` and exercises the solver-module form.
- **`fvModelChannel2D`** — same radiation problem as `diffuseSlab2D`,
  but the radiation library is wired into `incompressibleFluid`
  (driven by `foamRun`) via the `opticalRadiation` fvModel. Exercises
  the fvModel embedding path end-to-end; `Alltest` requires
  bit-for-bit `G` agreement with `diffuseSlab2D`.

`tutorials/Alltest` is the orchestrator: builds (cheap if up-to-date),
runs every case's `Allrun`, runs each case's `validate` script if
present, and performs cross-case bit-for-bit diffs:
`absorbingScatteringBox3D` vs `variableExtinctionBox3D` (constant vs.
species-driven extinction, same physics) and `fvModelChannel2D` vs
`diffuseSlab2D` (fvModel vs. standalone solver, same radiation
problem). Exits 0 only if every check passes.

## Planned: rename intensity → radiance identifiers

Code comments and prose now use "radiance" (W/m²/sr) consistently;
remaining occurrences of "intensity" are code-level identifiers that
were left in place to minimise churn:

- Class `Foam::optical::intensityRay` (and its directory / file names
  `src/opticalRadiationModels/DOM/intensityRay/intensityRay.{H,C,I.H}`).
- Static member `intensityRay::intensityPrefix` ("I", used to build
  the per-ray field name `I_<band>_<angle>`).
- Constructor parameter name `const volScalarField& intensity` in
  `radiationModel`/`DOM` constructors.

When this is picked up:

- Rename the class to `radianceRay` (or just `ray`); rename the
  directory and files in step.
- Rename `intensityPrefix` → `radiancePrefix`. The on-disk field
  name `I` is conventional in radiation literature and should stay,
  so the prefix's *value* remains `"I"` even though its identifier
  changes.
- Rename the constructor parameter to `radiance`.

Mostly mechanical; affects ~50 lines plus a directory rename. Best
done as its own commit so the diff stays reviewable.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request. It pulls the
pre-built `ghcr.io/degrootresearchgroup/of-optical-radiation-ci`
image (built by `docker-publish.yml` from the repo's `Dockerfile`),
runs `./Allwmake`, and then `cd tutorials && ./Alltest`. Passes only
if every tutorial's `validate` script passes and the cross-case diff
matches.
